-> A block free-falls from a randomly chosen position in the sky. 

-> We have a magnetic train in which we can control the force applied to the actuators in order for it to move. 

-> The train moves along a railway track inclined with the ground at any angle of choice.

-> Once the block starts falling we assume that we are given the position of the block with the help of some kind of sensor.

-> OBJECTIVE : The magnetic train must catch the block and then stop.
